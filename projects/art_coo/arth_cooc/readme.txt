###Metdata for arthropod co-occurrence study data sets

#Current analyses of arth_cooc_PIT_lau.csv with redos added on show:
#1 - genotype affects SES of co-occurrence analyses
#2 - this difference is driven by two genotypes that have contrasting
#patterns (1017 and 11)
#3 - SES is not correlated with any PB counts


#pb_inspection.csv
#pb galls from all leaves for trees with pb were collected
#all collected galls were surveyed for the presence of dipteran larvae and fungi
#surveys were conducted by slicing open galls with a razor blade and visually inspected using a 10x hand lens
#galls were considered woody if they had dark brown to grey lignified tissue
#galls were considered fungal if hyphae were distinctly visible (powdery white was not conisdered fungal)
#only entire, un-attacked galls were surveyed
#note: difficult to distinguish between fungal hyphae and what could be silk from lep larvae
