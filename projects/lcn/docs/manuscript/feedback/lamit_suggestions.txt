Hey, I never took a detailed look at you lichen paper because you said
you wanted to revise it response to lab group comments.  However, I
took a quick skim and would suggest a couple things about background
lit.  

First, take a look at the attached papers on interactions in
relation to genetics. Since they are experiential, I would use them
instead of Joe's paper, and if you want a cottonwood paper, i would
use Dave's pemphagus paper instead of Joe's and maybe Gina's cross
type level aphid removal paper. 

The  cool thing about your lichen
work, which sets it apart, is that it does not involve trophic
interactions like all the other papers do.  

Also, I think you could
use an infusion of lit from the lichen world, and I could send  you a
few pertinent papers if you would like.
