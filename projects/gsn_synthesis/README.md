# Selection simulations

- shift the abundances of genotypes
- assume constant population size
- quantify network structure
- could use the bipartite network robustness simulation as a model
- could also use Savaedra's node importance as well

# Indirect genetic effects at the community scale

- couple networks together a la Poisot's paper
- examine pathway proliferation

# Genotype-Species Networks

- Synthetic network analysis of the genotype level community data
- Genotypic variability in interactions generates structure in
ecological networks
- Simulations (comGenR)
- Possible real datasets
 - Richard Michalet and Patrick Hajek
 - Randy Bangert
 - Gina Wimp
 - Jen Schweitzer
 - Dylan Fisher
 - Joe Bailey
 - Anurag Agrawal
 - Jamie Lamit
 - Todd Wojtowicz
 - Zaccheus Compson
 - Kitty Gehring
 - Posy Busby
 - Art Keith
- Main Hypothesis:
 - Genotype species networks should be nested
 - Genotype species networks should also contain modules
- Main Analyses:
 - Weighted Nestendess
 - Weighted Modularity
 - Other?
