\section*{Introduction}

The dynamics of species interactions are fundamental to the
evolution of biodiversity. Thompson (1999) wrote that, ``the history
of evolution and biodiversity is fundamentally a history of the
evolution of species interactions.'' And Darwin in ``Origins'' described
communities as ``tangled'' banks (Darwin 1859). Primarily developed as
coevolutionary theory, extensive research has shown empirically that
species interactions contribute to the generation of diversity in
ecosystems \citep{ehrlich1964}.

Recently, the advances in the field of community genetics have
begun to put complex communities into an evolutionary
framework. Historically, investigations and the theory of the
evolution of species interactions have focused on one or a few
species; however, the complexity of communities arising from both
species richness and indirect effects suggest that a purely
reductionistic approach is likely to yield limited insight into
species rich communities \citep{antonovics1992}. And over the past 20
years multiple studies have shown that genetic variation within a
single species can have community and ecosystem consequences
\citep{fritz1988,wimp2004,johnson2005,strauss2005,crutsinger2006,whitham2006}. In
addition, evolutionary theory has expanded to incorporate greater
complexity beyond simple two-way interactions \citep{shuster2006,wade2007}.


Network theory originated over 300 years ago with the work of Leonard
Euler to address problems of relationships among discrete
entities, and now the application of network theory to studies of
ecological interactions are providing a useful framework for
addressing both theoretical and analytical challenges in community
genetics. Starting at least as early as Robert MacArthur's work on community stability, network
theoretic methods have been applied to community ecology
\citep{macarthur1955}. Following in these footsteps, many
theoretical and empirical advances have been made employing a
network approach, including work on ecological complexity
\citep{may1972}, food-webs \citep{cohen1979}, plant-animal
interactions \citep{bascompte2003,thebault2010}. Recently, researchers
have started to apply network theoretic methods to evolutionary
questions \citep{ohtsuki2006,guimaraes2011}. 


The goals of this dissertation are to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explore how real communities evolve as networks of ecologically
  connected species,
\item Integrate community genetics and network dynamics theory, and
\item Develop useful theoretical and computational methods for
  evolutionary network research.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Review: Ecological and evolutionary interaction network
  exploration (Lau et al. 2010)}

\subsection*{Abstract}

Ecological communities play an integral role in determining ecosystem
functions. However, community-level patterns and processes are
complex because they are typically comprised of many interacting
components. Therefore, pair-wise reductionist investigations of
interactions among species are unlikely to reveal the dynamics of the
whole community. Here, we present results from a study of the
interactions among members of a lichen community associated with
different genotypes of a foundation tree species, \textit{Populus
angustifolia}. Three key findings emerge. First, null-model based
analysis of species co-occurrence patterns suggest that interactions
are likely contributing to lichen community structure. Second, the
pattern of co-occurrences and pair-wise correlations of lichen species
suggest that interactions among lichens are primarily
facilitative. Third, the significance and magnitude of co-occurrence
patterns vary among genotypes of \textit{P. angustifolia} suggesting that the
strength of facilitative interactions among lichens is tree genotype
dependent. In combination, direct and indirect plant genetic effects
on the inter- actions of lichens appear to play an important role in
defining the lichen community. We believe that a community genetics
approach focused on foundation species will allow researchers to
better understand the selection pressures that shape communities and
that many unexpected outcomes will emerge. From this perspective we
discuss future research directions that employ greater analytical
power to further quantify the complex network of species interactions
within communities.

\section{Genetically based phenotypic variation in foundation species
  influences lichen species co-occurrence patterns.}

\subsection*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Species interactions are an important component of biological
  diversity, contributing to the dynamics of communities and ecosystems.
\item Only recently have ecologists begun to put communities into an
  evolutionary context, and in particular the evolution of species
  interactions have typically been studied in small groups of species
  (i.e. pairs and triplets).
\item As interactions are difficult to quantify directly, we will use
  a co-occurrence pattern based approach to infer potential shifts in
  the underlying structure of interactions.
\item Using lichen communities as a model system, we will ask how
  genetic variation in a foundation species influences the
  co-occurrence patterns in multi-species community.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lichen co-occurrence patterns will depend on the
  genetics of the foundation tree species (\textit{Populus
    angustifolia} and \textit{Pinus edulis}).
\item Variation in heritable traits of the foundation species produce these
  co-occurrence patterns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lichen co-occurrence patterns will be quantified in two
  ecosystems to provide greater generality of the findings:
\item \textit{Populus angustifolia} riparian forest, Utah
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Surveys will be done in two common gardens with replicated
    genotypes and in an adjacent wild stand of \textit{Po. angustifolia}.
  \item Epiphytic lichen will be observed on the trunk of each tree.
  \item Occurrences will be recorded for all species in 1cm$^2$ cells of a
    10cm$^2$ quadrat on each tree.
  \item Tree traits, such as bark roughness and size, will be recorded
    for each surveyed tree.
  \item All lichen species have been confirmed by an expert
    lichenologist (R.R. Naesborg).
  \end{itemize}
\item \textit{Pinus edulis} arid woodland, Arizona
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Rock lichen will be surveyed on rocks directly beneath the
    canopies of \textit{Pi. edulis} in a common environment.
  \item Lichen species occurrences will be quantified in cells of each
    quadrat.
  \item Previous work in this system has shown that susceptibility to
    an herbivorous moth, which has both community and ecosystem
    consequences, is genetically based.
  \item Tree trait data will be recorded for each tree, including
    canopy architecture variables relating to herbivore damage and
    under-story plant cover.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Anticipated Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item Previous studies in both systems have shown that lichen
  community composition tracks genetically based trait variation.
\item Lichen species often interact both through competition
  (e.g. space) and photobiont stealing and often exhibit co-occurrence
  patterns, depending on the environmental context.
\item Thus, co-occurrence patterns will vary significantly depending
  on the underlying genetic gradient of the foundation species.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intra-specific variation in a foundation tree species
  influences herbivore interaction network structure.}

\subsection*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Plant-herbivore interactions are key components of ecosystems
  and have been a useful model system for studying the evolution of
  species interactions.
\item The modeling of plant-herbivore interactions as bipartite
  networks has helped to advance the theory of community level
  dynamics in these systems.
\item Here, we will investigate how genetic variation in an foundation tree
  species influences the structure of plant-herbivore interaction
  networks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}
\item Plant genetics contributes to phenotypic variation in traits
  controlling plant-herbivore interactions that will influence the
  structure of interaction networks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item Observations of canopy arthropod species will be conducted at
  two scales of genetic variability in a common garden setting:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Trees forming a gradient of species hybridization (\textit{Po. angustifolia}
    x \textit{Po. fremontii}).
  \item Trees of known genotype (\textit{Po. angustifolia}).
  \end{enumerate}
\item In addition, surveys of canopy arthropods will also be conducted
  at the scale of both individual leaves and branches on
  \textit{Populus angustifolia}.
\item Network structure will be explored at three scales:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The hybridizing stand scale using trees along the hybrid
    gradient.
  \item The single species stand scale using replicated trees of know
    genotype.
  \item The scale of single trees using intra-tree replicates at both
    the finer scales of branches and leaves.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Anticipated Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extensive work in this system has shown that community
  composition of canopy arthropods is strongly influenced by genetic
  variation across the hybridizing complex and within species.
\item In addition, previous work has shown that arthropod trophic interactions
  vary among genotypes.
\item We therefore can expect:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Both hybridization and intra-species genetic variation to
    contribute to the structure of bipartite plant-herbivore networks, and
  \item Co-occurrence patterns of canopy arthropods to vary among
    genotypes.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{The evolution of ecological networks in foundation species
  driven ecosystems: A simulation based approach}

\subsection*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item The theory of the evolution of ecological interactions is based
  on overly simplified systems of one or a few species.
\item Network theory has enabled the investigation of complex
  (i.e. multi-species) communities from a mathematically rooted
  framework.
\item An important concept in community genetics is that communities
  are primarily structured by one or a few species that drive the
  ecology and evolution of many other species. 
\item From a network perspective, we can say that ecological and
  evolutionary networks should tend to be centralized.
\item Empirical investigations of the functional consequences of
  network structure is that centralized networks tend to be highly
  resistance to random species loss; however, targeted loss of the
  central species tends to produce global instabilities.
\item In this study, we will develop and use a network dynamics model
  to investigate the influence of ecological network centralization on
  the evolution of both local and global network structure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hypotheses}
\begin{itemize}
\item Network centralization will tend to stabilize ecological
  networks
\item The evolution of species in the network will tend to track the
  evolution of the most central species
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item Design network dynamics simulator
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Individual based model
  \item Traits of individuals from species specifications
  \item Interactions are determined by traits
  \end{itemize}
\item Simulations will be parameterized for three scenarios:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item High centralization
  \item Moderate centralization
  \item Low centralization
  \end{itemize}
\item Simulations will be carried out on the Cottonwood server, Amazon
  cloud or other server for computationally intensive tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Anticipated Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item Previous analytical and simulation based studies have shown
  strong connections between ecological network structure and
  stability.
\item Also, recent work has shown that ecological network structure
  has direct consequences for the propagation of evolutionary dynamics
  in simulations of species removals.
\item Thus, we can expect that network structure, i.e. centralization or ``foundation-ness'',
  will determine the evolutionary dynamics of the community. 
\end{itemize}
