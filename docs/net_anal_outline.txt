General
Q. Does genetics influence composition
- Composition PerMANOVA for genotype
Q. Do individuals contribute to bipartite network structure?
- Bipartite network (whole and condensed)
Q. Does genetics contribute to interaction network structure by
influencing interaction frequency?
- Stand level unipartite networks (whole and condensed)
- Tree level unipartite networks (tree and net average)
- Co-occurrence analyses
Q. Do these networks have a characteristic sturcture?
- Network statistics (node, module and network)
- QAP test
- Node correlations

ENS (Ecological Network Simulation)

- generate communities with varying genetics
- analyze composition
- model bipartite network using trees as reps
- test nestedness using equiprobable-equiprobable
- model unipartite network
- test for network structural differences
- test for correlation between degree and strength of selection

LCO
- test for the effect of height
- test compositional effect using tree level sums
- construct 

ACN
